ON LEARNING ENGLISH</strong></span></span></span></p><span>

<p align="left"><span><span lang="EN-US">Read
the text «On Learning English». Make a list of new words and expressions<i>.</i></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">When I think about
my future career, I dream of becoming a highly qualified specialist. Nowadays,
however, education plays a central role in the selection of men and women for
jobs, which require high qualification. Moreover, it is impossible to make any
career without good knowledge of foreign languages. I think English will be
required regularly in my future work. I expect to use English in speaking and
listening face to face and in telephone, radio, television communication. I
also expect to use English in reading magazines professional journals, reports,
newspapers, in reading and writing business letters. I will be using English
with my colleagues and with members of community at large. I need English for
broadly socio-cultural purposes: to obtain information, to convene at
multinational gatherings, to travel. I know that nowadays at the airport or in
a hotel bar a person of any nationality would address me directly in English
without asking (me) whether1 speak the language: Some degree of command is
taken for granted.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">There are also some
general interests and activities where I need English, such as: entertainment
at home (radio, TV, etc.), friends, social gatherings (parties etc.), films,
theatre, music, cultural interests, travel, sports, community activities, transportation,
shopping, international exhibitions and many other needs.</span></p>
