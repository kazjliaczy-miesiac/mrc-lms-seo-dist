<p><b><span lang="EN-US">READING: CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION.</span></b><b><span lang="EN-US"> </span></b></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">What
are telecommunications?</span></i></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Telecommunications
refers to the transmission of signals over a distance for the purpose of
communication. Information is transmitted by devices such as the telephone,
radio, television, satellite, or computer networks. Examples could be two
people speaking on their mobile phone, a sales department sending a fax to a
client, or even someone reading the teletext pages on TV. But in the modern
world, telecommunications mainly means transferring information across the
Internet, via modem, phone lines or wireless networks. Because of
telecommunications, people can now work at home and communicate with their
ofﬁce by computer and telephone. This is called teleworking. It has been
predicted that about one third of all work could eventually be performed
outside the workplace. In call centers assistance or support is given to
customers using the telephone, email or online chats. They are also used for
telemarketing, the process of selling goods and services over the phone. </span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">Digital TV and radio </span></i></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">In
recent years, TV and radio broadcasting has been revolutionized by developments
in satellite and digital transmission. Digital TV is a way of transmitting
pictures by means of digital signals, in contrast to the analogue signals used
by traditional TV. Digital TV offers interactive services and pay multimedia-
that is, it can transmit movies and shows to TV sets or PCs on a pay—per—view
basis. It is also widescreen, meaning programs are broadcast in a native 16:9
format instead of the old 4:3 format. Digital TV provides a better quality of
picture and sound and allows broadcasters to deliver more channels. Digital
Terrestrial TV is received via a set-top box, a device that decodes the signal
received through the aerial. New technologies are being devised to allow you to
watch TV on your mobile. For example, DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) and
DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcast—Handheld) can send multimedia (radio, TV and
data) to mobile devices. Audio programs (music, news, sports, etc.) are also transmitted
in a digital radio format called DAB (Digital Audio Broadcasting)</span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">Mobile communications</span></i></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Thanks
to wireless connectivity, mobile phones and BlackBerrys now let you check your
email, browse the Web and connect with home or company intranets, all without
wires.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">The use
of GPS in cars and PDAs is widespread, so you can easily navigate in a foreign
city or ﬁnd the nearest petrol station. In the next few years, GPS chips will
be incorporated into most mobile phones. Another trend is wearable computers.
Can you imagine wearing a PC on your belt and getting email on your sunglasses?
Some devices are equipped with a wireless modern, a keypad and a small screen;
others are activated by voice. The users of wearable technology are sometimes
even called cyborgs! The term was invented by Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline
in 1960 to describe cybernetic organisms — beings that are part robot, part human.</span></p>
